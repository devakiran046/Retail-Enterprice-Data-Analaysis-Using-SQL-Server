# Retail Enterprise Data Analysis using SQL Server

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an enterprise-level retail dataset using
Microsoft SQL Server. The goal of the analysis is to extract meaningful
business insights related to sales performance, profitability, returns,
refunds, and delivery efficiency using structured SQL queries.

The project demonstrates practical SQL skills applied to a real-world
business dataset and serves as a foundation for building an interactive
Power BI dashboard.

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Microsoft Excel (source data – multiple workbooks)
- GitHub (version control & project sharing)
- Power BI (dashboard development – upcoming)

---

## Dataset Description
The Retail Enterprise dataset consists of multiple interconnected tables,
including:
- Orders and Order Line details
- Product information
- Sales and profit metrics
- Returns and refund data
- Fulfillment and delivery status

The data was imported into SQL Server from multiple Excel workbooks and
modeled using relational joins for analysis.

## SQL Analysis Performed
The project includes analysis such as:
- Sales and profit analysis across products and categories
- Identification of loss-making products and sub-categories
- Return rate and refund analysis
- Comparison of resell vs write-off returns
- Impact of late deliveries on returns and refunds
- Seasonal performance analysis using product attributes

---

## SQL Concepts Used
- INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN
- CASE WHEN for conditional logic
- Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Percentage and ratio calculations
- Data validation and optimization techniques

---

## Key Business Insights
- Late deliveries show a higher likelihood of product returns
- Certain product categories generate consistent losses despite high sales
- Write-off returns contribute significantly to refund costs
- Seasonal trends impact both sales volume and return rates
- Refund values are higher for delayed or failed deliveries

---

## Project Documentation
- SQL queries were written and executed in SQL Server Management Studio
- Outputs were validated using result grids and screenshots
- SQL logic and insights were documented for clarity and reproducibility

---

## Next Steps
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard using the same SQL Server database
- Create SQL views for KPIs such as sales, profits, returns, and delivery metrics
- Enable dynamic filtering and drill-down analysis in Power BI
- Publish dashboard insights alongside this repository

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates:
- Real-world SQL problem-solving skills
- Business-oriented data analysis
- Clean and structured query writing
- End-to-end workflow from data ingestion to insights
- Readiness for Data Analyst / Business Intelligence roles
